# DynamixelSerialServo_ArduinoRoboArm
The origin library for serial control of the Dynamixel Servo (especially AX-12) through Arduino (MEGA 2560) is based on Josue Alejandro Savage's great work.
The Robot arm consists of 4 AX-12 servos. Please turn to blog.makeshare.xyz for more updated information.
